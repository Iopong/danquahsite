So, there were a lot of considerations when it came to how to put this site together. I considered using media/blog platforms like `medium` but didn't feel quite right about it. Not that I'm knocking those that do. I wanted to build to just build a simple static site that would lend itself to easy modifications or features, and posts. I came across Jekyll which seemed to answer all my questions. 

Jekyll is a blogware that generates static sites -> In english it essentially means that you only focus on writing static content via html, markdown, and Jekyll works its magic serves it up nicely for you. There's no need to worry about server code etc. Every update you need to make can be done through your `markdown`, `html`, and `css`. That's it. Pretty easy. It was created by this [Tom Preston][tom-preston]. I followed this wonderful tutorial by [Tania Rascia][tania-rascia].
This site's layout, and inspiration came from [Paul O'Shannessy][zpao]. Anywho, I look forward to learning, and sharing with you all.
